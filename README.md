# Lucas's dotfiles

Preferences and configurations for *nix, OS X, and certain software. A work in progress.

## Copying

Feel free to copy whatever you feel can be useful to you. Most everything in these files has been cut-and-paste from others' dotfiles anyway.

I've made an effort to keep things seperable from applications and my username and etc. but do not guarantee that this is so.

## Thanks
